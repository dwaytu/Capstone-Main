# DASIA: AN INTEGRATED SECURITY OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT PLATFORM FOR DAVAO SECURITY & INVESTIGATION AGENCY, INC.

## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Project Context

Armed security agencies in the Philippines operate under Philippine National Police (PNP) regulatory oversight managing complex operational functions including personnel deployment, equipment allocation, vehicle logistics, and incident response. Traditional security operations management relies on fragmented systems—separate platforms for personnel scheduling, equipment tracking, and vehicle management, or manual coordination through spreadsheets. This fragmentation creates operational inefficiencies including scheduling conflicts, equipment accountability gaps, inability to coordinate rapid personnel replacements, and incomplete audit trails.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems address similar integration challenges by consolidating business processes and enabling real-time information access (O'Brien, 2011). Applied to security operations, an integrated platform provides comprehensive workforce management, integrated equipment lifecycle tracking with audit logging, and unified operational visibility. This aligns with broader organizational digital transformation trends, where 71% of organizations in the United States have adopted advanced digital technologies to improve operational efficiency (European Investment Bank, 2022).

### 1.2 Purpose and Description

The primary purpose of this capstone project is to deliver a fully functional, production-ready Integrated Security Operations Management Platform that consolidates guard personnel management, equipment allocation, vehicle operations, and access control into a unified system.

DASIA is a comprehensive web-based application with a Rust/Axum backend API, PostgreSQL database, and React/TypeScript frontend with responsive design, deployed via Docker containerization. The platform provides core modules for: (1) Guard Management—shift scheduling, attendance tracking, performance monitoring, and replacement coordination ensuring continuous personnel coverage; (2) Equipment Management—firearm inventory, allocation workflows, permit tracking, and maintenance scheduling complying with PNP licensing requirements; (3) Vehicle Operations—armored car fleet management, vehicle allocation, driver assignment with certification verification, and trip tracking; and (4) Access Control—role-based permissions, authentication, and comprehensive audit logging. The system has been validated through 24-day operational simulation covering 24 distinct business scenarios and resolving 15+ production issues.

### 1.5 Review of Related Literature

**Enterprise Resource Planning Systems**
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems integrate multiple business functions—finance, human resources, supply chain management, and operations—into unified systems sharing common databases (O'Brien, 2011). ERP principles apply directly to security operations, where separate systems for personnel, equipment, and vehicles prevent holistic management. Research on public sector implementations identifies cultural factors and organizational change management as critical success elements applicable to security agencies (Chang, Gable, Smythe, & Timbrell, 2000).

**Workforce Management**
Workforce Management (WFM) systems optimize personnel productivity and engagement through automated scheduling, forecasting, and performance management (Wikipedia, 2025). Modern approaches emphasize not only cost reduction but also employee engagement and work-life balance. Field service management principles—applying WFM to geographically dispersed operations—directly apply to security personnel management across multiple client sites (Wikipedia, 2025).

**Digital Transformation and Operations Management**
Digital transformation extends beyond isolated system implementations to fundamental organizational redesign using digital technologies (Vial, 2019). For security operations, transformation encompasses process automation, data integration, real-time visibility, and compliance automation. Research identifies the TOP framework addressing transformation success: Technology (appropriate systems and infrastructure), Organization (cultural and governance changes), and People (workforce skill development) (Wamba & Queiroz, 2022).

**Security Operations and Access Control**
Security management addresses protection of physical assets, information, and operations through systematic risk management (Schneier, 2008). Role-based access control represents a foundational principle, enabling appropriate operational boundaries and audit capability (Mead & Goel, 2012). Comprehensive logging and monitoring support regulatory compliance and incident investigations (NIST, 2013).

**Technology Stack Literature**
Rust programming language emphasis on memory safety and thread safety reduces common security vulnerabilities in systems code (Klabnik & Nichols, 2023). React's component-based architecture enables maintainable, testable user interface development (Meta Platforms, Inc., 2024). PostgreSQL's advanced features enable efficient modeling of relational security operations data (PostgreSQL Global Development Group, 2024). Docker containerization facilitates reproducible deployment across environments (Docker Inc., 2023).
